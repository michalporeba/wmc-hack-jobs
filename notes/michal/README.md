# Micha≈Ç's Notes

We can only look at the information publically available at https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/. 
This limits the amount of data we have to work with, at least right now. 

[National Archives](https://nationalarchivies.org.uk) contains historical versions of the https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/ website.
This could provide us with more data, but the only API available, the [Discovery](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/) allows only to brows the content catalogue. 
The API appears not to be open, it requires registration and submitting an IP address. 
**It is not feasible to use it in the time constraints we have**
